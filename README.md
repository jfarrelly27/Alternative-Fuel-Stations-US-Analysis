This project utilizes Python scripts to analyze and visualize data on alternative fuel stations across the United States. The data, sourced from the "Alternative Fuel Stations 2021.csv" file provided by the US Department of Energy and published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, offers a comprehensive view of the distribution and trends of alternative fuel stations.

The project comprises two main Python scripts:

**utilities.py** houses a suite of functions designed for data analysis and visualization. These functions enable tasks such as plotting fuel type distributions, displaying access type distributions, listing states and territories by their number of alternative fuel locations, and more. 

**main.py** leverages the functions defined in utilities.py to execute the analysis and generate the visualizations, presenting the results in the console and as plots.

By offering valuable insights into the current state and trends of alternative fuel infrastructure in the United States, this project serves as a useful resource for stakeholders interested in the development of alternative fuels, including policy makers, researchers, and businesses in the energy sector.
